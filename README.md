Hedged HTTP client which helps to reduce tail latency at scale.

## Rationale

See paper [Tail at Scale](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2013/2/160173-the-tail-at-scale/fulltext) by Jeffrey Dean, Luiz Andr√© Barroso. In short: the client first sends one request, but then sends an additional request after a timeout if the previous hasn't returned an answer in the expected time. The client cancels remaining requests once the first result is received.

## Acknowledge

Thanks to [Bohdan Storozhuk](https://github.com/storozhukbm) for the review and powerful hints.

## Features

* Simple API.
* Easy to integrate.
* Optimized for speed.
* Clean and tested code.
* Dependency-free.

## Install

Go version 1.16+

```
go get github.com/cristalhq/hedgedhttp
```

## Example

```go
ctx := context.Background()
req, err := http.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, http.MethodGet, "https://google.com", http.NoBody)
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

timeout := 10 * time.Millisecond
upto := 7
transport := http.DefaultTransport
hedged, stats := hedgedhttp.NewRoundTripperAndStats(timeout, upto, transport)

// print stats periodically
go func() {
	for {
		time.Sleep(time.Second)
		fmt.Printf("stats: %+v\n", stats)
	}
}()

// will take `upto` requests, with a `timeout` delay between them
resp, err := hedged.RoundTrip(req)
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
defer resp.Body.Close()

// and do something with resp
```
